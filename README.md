## Aim  
To develop a **prompt-based personal productivity assistant** using ChatGPT, showcasing the progression from simple prompt design to adaptive interaction for managing tasks, scheduling reminders, suggesting wellness tips, and answering general queries.  

---

## AI Tools Required  
- ChatGPT (LLM)  
- Prompt engineering techniques  
- *(Optional)* Python/command-line or web-based UI  

---

## Explanation  
The application leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to create a **personal productivity assistant**. Unlike traditional systems, it interacts in **natural language**, adapts to user preferences, and enhances task management efficiency.  

The development follows three levels:  

- **Level 1 (Basic Prompting):** Simple reminders and task inputs.  
- **Level 2 (Contextual Prompting):** Task organization, scheduling conflicts, summaries.  
- **Level 3 (Adaptive Prompting):** Memory-based personalization, wellness tracking, intelligent suggestions.  

---

## Prompt
Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders,
suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural
language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time.

## Procedure  

| Step No. | Activity | Description |  
|----------|-----------|-------------|  
| 1 | Requirement Definition | Define daily tasks, scheduling, wellness, and query answering. |  
| 2 | Prompt Construction | Create specific prompts for each feature. |  
| 3 | Simulation of Interaction | Test using ChatGPT or simple UI. |  
| 4 | Feedback & Adaptation | Refine prompts based on user inputs. |  
| 5 | Integration of Memory | Add preference storage for personalization (optional). |  

---

## Expected Output  

### Table 1: Core Features of the Assistant  

| Feature | Functionality | Example Prompt | Example Output |  
|---------|---------------|----------------|----------------|  
| Task Manager | Add, prioritize, and remind tasks | “Remind me to call mom at 6 PM” | ✅ Reminder set at 6 PM |  
| Scheduler | Detect conflicts, suggest slots | “Schedule study after 3 PM lab” | 📌 Study block added 6–8 PM |  
| Wellness Tips | Suggest health & lifestyle advice | “Give me a wellness tip” | 🌱 “Take a 10-min walk” |  
| Query Handler | Answer academic/general queries | “Explain Bernoulli’s principle” | ✍️ Detailed explanation provided |  

---

### Graph 1: Evolution of Prompt Complexity  
Adaptiveness ↑
|        ● Level 3 (Adaptive)
|
|   ● Level 2 (Contextual)
|
| ● Level 1 (Basic)
|__________________________→ Task Complexity

- Level 1 → Simple, direct reminders.  
- Level 2 → Handles context and multi-step instructions.  
- Level 3 → Learns preferences and adapts responses.

## Sample Simulation  

**User:**  
`Remind me to submit my assignment by 8 PM and suggest a quick break.`  

**Assistant:**  
✅ Task reminder set: Submit assignment at 8 PM.  
☕ Suggested break: 15-minute stretch at 3:30 PM.  

---

**User:**  
`Tomorrow I have a lab from 10–1, add study time in evening.`  

**Assistant:**  
📌 Study block 6–8 PM added. No conflicts detected.  

---

**User:**  
`Wellness tip for today.`  

**Assistant:**  
🌱 Drink 2L water, add 20-min digital detox after dinner.  

---

## Result  
The lab exercise produced a **prototype concept for a prompt-driven personal assistant**. Students achieved:  

- Mastery of **prompt engineering techniques**.  
- Application of **LLM intelligence** for real-world productivity.  
- Understanding of **adaptive AI behavior** with user preference integration.  
- Visualization of AI as a **tool for daily problem-solving**.  

Thus, this experiment highlights how **prompt-based applications bridge human needs and AI intelligence**, forming the foundation for more advanced productivity systems.
